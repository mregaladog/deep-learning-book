### Comment on this book by Elon Musk

This is not available as PDF download. So, I have taken the prints of the HTML content and binded into a flawless PDF version of the book, as suggested by the website itself.

What is the best way to print the HTML format?

Printing seems to work best printing directly from the browser, using Chrome. Other browsers do not work as well.

- The pdf version of the book which is available in html at http://www.deeplearningbook.org/
- The book is available in chapter wise PDFs as well as complete book in PDF.
